How (not?) to run an arts/culture/project space

## About

Ptarmigan is a cultural platform based in [Helsinki, Finland](http://ptarmigan.fi) and [Tallinn, Estonia](http://ptarmigan.ee).

This is the code that runs both Ptarmigan sites. This was started in 2009 on Rails 2.1 and slowly hacked together over the years to suit the very custom nature of a two-city non-profit project space. 

I doubt there will be much interest in the code, but feel free to get in touch if you have any questions. This is hacked at in my spare time and will one day, hopefully, function well.

Perhaps if you run a similar organisation there will be something of value to you here.
